# UnityGameJamProject
"Udder destruction" is a game Ben Brown, Jordan Flood, and I made for a Game Jam hosted by A&amp;M.
The Theme was "role reversal" and we were given 3 days to complete this project.
This is a short game about cows in a ufo attacking aliens.

Jordan flood was responsible for the visuals, Ben Brown and I were responsible for the c# code.
